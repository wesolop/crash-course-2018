# Welcome to Feb 2018 Crash Course!!!

## Syllabus

**Days 1-2: TDD**

We will learn how to work TDD by writing a game, using React & Node. I will have short live coding sessions followed by hands-on sessions.
Testing tools we will learn about: Selenium, Protractor, Mocha, Enzyme, Wallaby and much more.

**Day 3: Node Platform, CI/CD, and nothing to production**
- We will learn about Wix’s node infrastructure, conducting experiments, RPC calls, BI and much more, everything hands on (live coding followed by hands-on sessions) and completely TDD.
- We will learn about how CI/CD works @Wix and we will have a “Nothing to Prod” session. Each participate will do a full cycle of generating a new project -> CI -> LifeCycle -> Production
- We will learn how to debug production, NewRelic and more

**Days 4-5: Final Project**

Two days of final project - letting participates to implement everything they just learned in a “mini real world application”

# Testing terms / technologies

### Browser tests / E2E

Technologies: Selenium based libraries (Protractor, Nightwatch etc.). Chrome devtools (Puppeteer). Tests are running in node.

When we want to use them: browser dependent stuff (scrolling, measurements etc.), Navigation, API calls

### Component tests

Running tests on components using node and JSDOM. Mocha / Jest / Enzyme etc.

### Unit tests

Running tests on small units, using node

### IT tests

Running tests on API endpoints, using node
